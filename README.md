Create a database server & admin for PostgreSQL

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system before proceeding.

### Getting started

Follow these steps to start running your database:

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone
    ```

2. **Move to the right directory:**

    ```sh
    cd postgresql/postgresql-runner
    ```

3. **Set your environment variables:**

    Create a file named `.env` in the `postgresql-runner` directory and add the following variables:

    ```sh
    # PostgreSQL
    POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
    POSTGRES_USER=your_username
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    # PgAdmin
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=your_pgadmin_password
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PORT=8080
    ```

    Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, `your_password`, `your_email@example.com`, and `your_pgadmin_password` with your desired values.

4. **Build up the server:**

    Run the following command to build up the PostgreSQL server and PgAdmin interface:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. **Access the admin interface:**

    Once the server is up and running, you can access the PgAdmin interface by visiting [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.

### Example usage

Once you've accessed the PgAdmin interface, you can use it to manage your PostgreSQL database. You can create new databases, tables, and execute SQL queries as needed.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during setup, ensure that Docker is properly installed and running on your system.
- Double-check your environment variables in the `.env` file to ensure they are correctly configured.
